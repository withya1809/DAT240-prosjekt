# DAT240-project
Group 10


The purpose of this game is for a guesser to guess the label of an image with as few segments of the specific picture available as possible. There is a proposer player that will select images for the guesser player to see. The game starts with the guesser being shown one segment by the proposer. The objective for the paired players is to succeed with the lowest amount of segments as possible.

This is a web application, where you start by logging in. A logged in user is given the option of playing as a guesser or proposer. Once two players of different roles(guesser and proposer) are ready they will be directed to their own individual views. The proposer will start the game by selecting an image for the game and then the first segment to present to the guesser.

The Guesser have 3 tries per segment to guess the label. After 3 failed attempts he will be shown a new segment selected by the proposer. He can also ask for a new segment without doing the 3 attempts to guess on the available segments

The game continues until the guesser guesses the correct label for a given image or when all the segments are shown to the user.
